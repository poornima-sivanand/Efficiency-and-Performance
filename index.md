Efficiency and Performance: 
You will want to design your cloud environment so that it's cost-effective to operate and develop against. Inefficiency and waste in cloud spending should be identified to ensure you're spending money where we can make the greatest use of it. You need to have a good monitoring architecture in place so that you can detect failures and problems before they happen or, at a minimum, before your customers notice. You also need to have some visibility in to how your application is using its available resources, through a robust monitoring framework.


Shared responsibility
Moving to the cloud introduces a model of shared responsibility. In this model, your cloud provider will manage certain aspects of your application, leaving you with the remaining responsibility. In an on-premises environment you are responsible for everything. As you move to infrastructure as a service (IaaS), then to platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS), your cloud provider will take on more of this responsibility. This shared responsibility will play a role in your architectural decisions, as they can have implications on cost, operational capabilities, security, and the technical capabilities of your application. By shifting these responsibilities to your provider you can focus on bringing value to your business and move away from activities that aren't a core business function.
